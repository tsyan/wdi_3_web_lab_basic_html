# Basic HTML Lab

HappiTails needs your help again! In this lab we'll create a static web site for them, using what we've learned about HTML so far. No submission is required &ndash; this is just to get you comfortable writing your own markup.

## Specifications

* The main page (index.html) should contain a title and slogan
* List at least two clients on the main page, with links to more detailed client pages
* List at least two pets on the main page, with links to more detailed pet pages
* Client pages should contain the client's name, age, gender, and a list of their pets with links to the pet pages
* Pet pages should contain the pet's name, breed, age, gender, list of their favorite toys, and an image of them
* All pages should have no errors when run through the [W3C Validator](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) in HTML5 mode
